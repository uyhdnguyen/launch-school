#### Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would  
happen in the following scenarios:

1. what is != and where should you use it?
2. put ! before something, like !user_name
3. put ! after something, like words.uniq!
4. put ? before something
5. put ? after something
6. put !! before something, like !!user_name

>[!note]
> - `!=` means "not equals"
> - `!!<objects>` turns object into their boolean equivalent
> - `!<some_object>` turns object into the opposite of their boolean equivalent
