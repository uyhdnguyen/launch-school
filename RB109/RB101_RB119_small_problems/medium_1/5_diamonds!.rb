# Diamonds!
# Write a method that displays a 4-pointed diamond in an n x n grid, where n is
# an odd integer that is supplied as an argument to the method. You may assume
# that the argument will always be an odd integer.

# Examples

# diamond(9)

#     *
#    ***
#   *****
#  *******
# *********
#  *******
#   *****
