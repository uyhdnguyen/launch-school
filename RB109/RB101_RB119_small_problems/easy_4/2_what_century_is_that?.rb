# Write a method that takes a year as input and returns the century.
# The return value should be a string that begins with the century number,
# and ends with st, nd, rd, or th as appropriate for that number.

# New centuries begin in years that end with 01. So, the years 1901-2000
# comprise the 20th century.

# Examples:

def century(year)
  century = (year/100) + 1
  century -= 1 if year % 100 == 0
  century.to_s + century_suffix(century)
end

def century_suffix(century)
  return 'th' if [11,12,13].include?(century % 100)
  last_digit = century % 10

 case last_digit
  when 1 then 'st'
  when 2 then 'nd'
  when 3 then 'rd'
  else 'th'
 end
end
