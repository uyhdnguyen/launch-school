# The Fibonacci series is a series of numbers (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...)
# such that the first 2 numbers are 1 by definition, and each subsequent number
# is the sum of the two previous numbers. This series appears throughout the
# natural world.

# Computationally, the Fibonacci series is a very simple series, but the results
# grow at an incredibly rapid rate. For example, the 100th Fibonacci number is
# 354,224,848,179,261,915,075 -- that's enormous, especially considering that
# it takes 6 iterations before it generates the first 2 digit number.

# Write a method that calculates and returns the index of the first Fibonacci
# number that has the number of digits specified as an argument. (The first
# Fibonacci number has index 1.)

# Examples:

# find_fibonacci_index_by_length(2) == 7          # 1 1 2 3 5 8 13
# find_fibonacci_index_by_length(3) == 12         # 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144
# find_fibonacci_index_by_length(10) == 45
# find_fibonacci_index_by_length(100) == 476
# find_fibonacci_index_by_length(1000) == 4782
# find_fibonacci_index_by_length(10000) == 47847
