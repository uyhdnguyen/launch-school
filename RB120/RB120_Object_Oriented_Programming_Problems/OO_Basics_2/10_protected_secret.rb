# Protected methods are very similar to private methods. The main difference between them is protected methods allow access between class instances, while private methods don't. If a method is protected, it can't be invoked from outside the class. This allows for controlled access, but wider access between class instances.

# In the solution, we pass person2 as an argument into #compare_secret. We then compare the value of @secret from person1 with the value of @secret from person2. We do this using the == operator which returns a boolean.
