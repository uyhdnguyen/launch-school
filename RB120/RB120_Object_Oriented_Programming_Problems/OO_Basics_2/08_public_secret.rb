# Using the following code, create a class named Person with an instance variable named @secret. Use a setter method to add a value to @secret, then use a getter method to print @secret.

class Person
  attr_accessor :secret
end

person1 = Person.new
person1.secret = 'Shh.. this is a secret!'
puts person1.secret

# All of the instance methods used in the exercises so far have been public methods. Public methods can be accessed from both within the class and outside the class.

# In the solution, we use attr_accessor to automatically create the getter and setter methods. They can also be written manually, like this:

class Person
  def secret
    @secret
  end

  def secret=(value)
    @secret = value
  end
end
