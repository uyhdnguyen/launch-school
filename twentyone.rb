---------- RULES ----------
=> OBJECTIVE:
=> The goal of Twenty-One is to try to get as close to 21 as possible,
=> without going over. If you go over 21, it's a "bust" and an
=> immediate loss.

=> SETUP:
=> The game consists of a "dealer" and a "player". Both participants
=> are initially dealt 2 cards. The player can see both their cards,
=> but can initially see only the first of the dealer's cards,
=> with the second card (the "hole" card) hidden from the player.

=> CARD VALUES:
=> Card numbers 2-10 are worth their face value. Jacks, queens,
=> and kings are each worth 10. Aces are worth either 1 or 11,
=> depending on the player's hand: an ace is counted as 11 if
=> it does not cause the hand's value to exceed 21; otherwise,
=> it is counted as 1.

MSG

RULES_PT2 = <<-MSG
---------- RULES ----------
=> GAMEPLAY:
=> The player goes first and can choose to "hit" to add more cards
=> to their hand, or "stay" to keep their current hand. If their
=> hand's total exceeds 21, the player busts and loses.

=> If the player stays without busting, the dealer's turn begins.
=> The dealer must hit until their total hand is at least 17, at which
=> point they must stay. If the dealer busts, the player wins.

=> If both the player and dealer stay without busting, then the total value
=> of each hand is compared and the winner is the one with the highest
=> value. If the values are the same, it's a tie, resulting in a "push".
